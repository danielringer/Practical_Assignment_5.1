# Practical Assignment 5.1
An analysis of drivers and their acceptance of a coupon. This analysis dives deeper into both Bar coupons and Coffee House coupons.

My hypotheses include:
- Most drivers who accept Bar coupons are under the age of 30 and are frequent bar goers.
- Though not testable with the current dataset, my hyposthesis is the higher coupon acceptance and its correlation to the higher temperature, could correlate to more time available for students during the summer months or perhaps an interest in iced coffee as opposed to hot coffee.

# My Findings
Initially, I found that of all coupons considered, the acceptance rate was just over 50% with the Coffee House coupons exceeding the rest.

Bar Coupons:
Driver acceptance of the Bar coupons was nearly 60%. I found that the majority (77%) of drivers that accepted these coupons frequented bars 3 or more times within the last month. Those that accepted the coupons that visited less were only 37%. I also found that 64% of drivers that frequent bars at least once per month are 25 and older while those under 30 made up 72% of drivers. Overall, I would suggest focusing coupons on drivers that are both younger and show frequency in visiting bars.

Coffee House:
My initial findings were that Coffee House coupon acceptance was 50/50. There is a strong correlation with coffee house visits less than 3 per month and 10am with 61% coupon acceptance. This brought me to considering if more coupons were accepted at 10am, perhaps the temperature may have affected that decision. The strongest correlation I found was the same number of visits previously mentioned is overwhelming stronger during warmer temperatures. These findings together tell me that drivers are most interested in Coffee House coupons during the earlier part of the day when it is warm out. This made me consider Students. If the weather is warm in the morning, one might assume that it is the Summer season. Students are often out of school during the Summer season. Using a heatmap, I found that across all levels of Coffee House visitations, students had the highest counts in warmer weather. Overall, I would suggest during the Summer months to consider concentrating the Coffee House coupons on students in the morning. 

# Next Steps
I would be interested in considering how a drivers destination would correlate to the Coffee House coupons. Do those that are headed to work in the morning show more interest in coffee or are those headed home in the afternoon need a pick me up after a long day? Another point of interest that should be evaluated is if the Coffee House is enroute to the destination. If the driver must turn around and move further from their destination to access the Coffee House, one would assume the acceptance rate would decrease.Finally, being I placed focus on students, I would look for those drivers with friend passengers with an assumption that they are also students.
