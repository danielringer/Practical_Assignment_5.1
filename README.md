# Practical Assignment 5.1
An analysis of drivers and their acceptance of a coupon. This analysis dives deeper into both Bar coupons and Coffee House coupons.

My hypotheses include:
- Most drivers who accept Bar coupons are under the age of 30 and are frequent bar goers.
- Though not testable with the current dataset, my hyposthesis is the higher coupon acceptance and its correlation to the higher temperature, could correlate to more time available for students during the summer months or perhaps an interest in iced coffee as opposed to hot coffee.
